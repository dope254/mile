data model
process model - coordination model

services:
    content generation ---+
        artifact
    app generation --
        components
    app configuration --
        project

---

the user answers some questionnaire
AI generates:
    stakeholders from questionnaire
    empathy maps from staekholders
    value propositions from the empathy maps of each stakeholder
    users stories from the value propositions
    usecases from userstories
    data model from the usecases
    process model from the usecases

The auto-system parses the generated content and:
configures:
    domain layer from data model
    application layer from process model
    repositories, external services from process model
    routes/endpoints from app layer app services
    UI components from domain layer entities and their attributes with state management for UI components inbuilt.
    actions for buttons

then the auto-sys packages the configured sys by:
    attaching the configured system to a relevant framework: eg flask, node etc
    the framework is configured prior with docker, kubernetes, circleci/gitworkflow, ansible

---

the system is previewed then deployed

---

we can thus say we have three app services:
    content generation
        entities: Artifact 
    app configuration
        entities: ?
    app packaging
        entities: ?



----

now we build a boiler plate app. It should have:
    frameworks
    package config
    configuration
    infrastructure layer

and also write some scripts to map design to app
